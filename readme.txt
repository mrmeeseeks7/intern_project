The script show_data is a MATLAB program that makes it east to both inspect and listen to HRTF data in the UCD-CIPIC format. It provides a graphic user interface that supports the following functionality:
1. Load HRTF data file
2. Simultaneously display several graphs
3. Change azimuths and elevations
4. Use logarithmic or linear scales
5. Apply or remove spectral smoothing
6. Listen to spatialized test sounds
7. Listen to custom loaded sounds at elevation and azimuths of choosing 

The companion function show_hor_data provides similar but more primitive functionality for inspecting and listening to HRTF data for the horizontal plane.
